\section{Statistical Background}\label{statistical-background}

\subsection{The Beta Distribution}\label{the-beta-distribution}

The beta distribution can be used in a generalized linear model when the
values of the dependent variable are bounded \(0 < y < 1\) (Coxe, West,
\& Aiken, 2013). The probability density function (pdf) of the beta
distribution is determined by two parameters, \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\),
that are called \enquote{shape} parameters:

\begin{center}
$f(y;\alpha,\beta)={\Gamma(\alpha+\beta)\over\Gamma(\alpha)\Gamma(\beta)}y^{\alpha-1}(1-y)^{\beta-1}$
\end{center}

where \(\Gamma(.)\) is the gamma function. One of the benefits of the
beta distribution is that it is flexible and can take a number of
distributional shapes (Figure 1).

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{beta_hurdle_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-2-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:unnamed-chunk-2}Beta probability density functions with
various combinations of shape parameters.}
\end{figure}

These parameters are not inherently meaningful to researchers, however.
Rigby, Stasinopoulos, Heller, and De Bastiani (2017)
\enquote{reparameterized} the beta distribution so that the two
parameters determining the shape of the distribution would be more
useful in a regression framework (but see Ferrari \& Cribari-Neto, 2004
for a different parameterization). Instead of predicting \(\alpha\) and
\(\beta\), they parameterize (i.e., algebraically rearrange parameters)
so that beta regression predicts two different parameters: \(\mu\)
(called the \enquote{location} parameter) and \(\sigma\) (called the
\enquote{scale} parameter), where \(\mu={\alpha\over(\alpha+\beta)}\)
and \(\sigma=\sqrt{1\over(\alpha+\beta+1)}\). \(\mu\) is equivalent to
the mean, and \(\sigma\) is related positively to the variance (note
that \(\sigma\) is \emph{not} the standard deviation, even though
\(\sigma\) commonly refers to the standard deviation). The variance is
equivalent to \(\sigma^2\mu(1-\mu)\), and there are two things to note
from this equation: First, the greater the \(\sigma\), the greater the
variance; second, the variance depends on the mean, which means that
beta regression will be naturally heteroskedastic (covered shortly).
Using this distribution in a regression framework cannot handle the
dependent variable taking on values 0 and 1---how can we model dependent
variables in the range \(0 \leq y \leq 1\)?

\subsection{Zero-One Inflated Beta
Distribution}\label{zero-one-inflated-beta-distribution}

Rigby et al. (2017) show that the beta distribution can be
\enquote{inflated} at 0 and 1, meaning the dependent variable contains
0s and 1s (i.e., \(0 \leq y \leq 1\)), the pdf for this beta inflated
distribution, \(\text{beinf}\), is:

\begin{center}
\[
\text{beinf}(y;\mu,\sigma,\nu,\tau) =
\begin{cases}
  p_0                             & \text{if } y = 0\\
  (1 - p_0 - p_1)f(y;\mu,\sigma)  & \text{if } 0 < y < 1\\
  p_1                             & \text{if } y = 1
\end{cases}
\]
\end{center}

for \(0 \leq y \leq 1\), where \(f(y;\mu,\sigma)\) is the beta pdf with
\(\mu\) and \(\sigma\) bounded \emph{between} zero and one. The two
additional parameters, \(\nu\) and \(\tau\), are related to \(p_0\) and
\(p_1\), respectively. \(p_0\) is the probability that a case equals
zero, \(p_1\) is the probability that a case equals one, and \(p_2\)
(i.e., \(1 - p_0 - p_1\)) is the probability that the case comes from
the beta distribution. In terms of these two additional parameters,
\(p_0 = {\nu \over (1 + \nu + \tau)}\) and
\(p_1 = {\tau \over (1 + \nu + \tau)}\). Rearranging these
algebraically, \(\nu\) is the odds that a case is 0 to being
\(0 < y < 1\), \(\nu = p_0 / p_2\), and \(\tau\) is the odds that a case
is a 1 to being \(0 < y < 1\), \(\tau = p_1 / p_2\).

\subsection{Beta Regression Models}\label{beta-regression-models}

The goal for a researcher now is to predict these four parameters,
\(\mu, \sigma, \nu, \tau\), from any number of predictor variables of
theoretical interest. All four parameters can be predicted by an
identical set of predictors, none of the same predictors, or any
mixture. Both \(\mu\) and \(\sigma\) have to be between zero and one
(since the beta distribution is bounded between 0 and 1), so one can use
the logistic link function to fit predicted values in this range. Both
\(\nu\) and \(\tau\) have to be greater than zero (since they are odds),
so one can use the log link function to fit predicted values in this
range. Imagine a researcher has one predictor of interest, \(x\). They
could include this variable as a predictor of all four variables with
the equations:

\begin{center}
$\text{log}({\mu \over 1 - \mu}) = \beta_{10} + \beta_{11}X$\\
$\text{log}({\sigma \over 1 - \sigma}) = \beta_{20} + \beta_{21}X$\\
$\text{log}(\nu) = \beta_{30} + \beta_{31}X$\\
$\text{log}(\tau) = \beta_{40} + \beta_{41}X$
\end{center}

Or equivalently:

\begin{center}
$\mu={1\over1+e^{-(\beta_{10}+\beta_{11}X)}}$\\
$\sigma={1\over1+e^{-(\beta_{20}+\beta_{21}X)}}$\\
$\nu = e^{\beta_{30} + \beta_{31}X}$\\
$\tau = e^{\beta_{40} + \beta_{41}X}$
\end{center}

where \(e^x\) is the natural exponential function. A different inflated
beta distribution can also be used when the dependent variable contains
0s but not 1s (e.g., \(0 \leq y < 1\)) or when it contains 1s but not 0s
(e.g., \(0 < y \leq 1\)). Let \(c\) be the value---0 or 1---that is
included (i.e., inflated). The pdf is:

\begin{center}
\[
\text{beinf}_c(y;\mu,\sigma,\nu) =
\begin{cases}
  p_c                             & \text{if } y = c\\
  (1 - p_c)f(y;\mu,\sigma)        & \text{if } 0 < y < 1\\
\end{cases}
\]
\end{center}

where \(\nu = p_c / (1 - p_c)\) and the remaining notation is the same
as in the zero-and-one inflated beta distribution. The same link
functions are used, but the fourth parameter, \(\tau\), is not included,
since the distribution is only inflated at \(c\). Lastly, if no 0s or 1s
are observed, the beta distribution alone can be used as the pdf. This
results in a beta regression where the researcher is only predicting the
location, \(\mu\), and shape, \(\sigma\). Since there is no inflation at
0 or 1, the latter two parameters, \(\nu\) and \(\tau\), are not
included.

\subsection{Modeling Bounded Variables Beyond the Zero Through One
Range}\label{modeling-bounded-variables-beyond-the-zero-through-one-range}

These beta regression models are commonly used when rates and
proportions are dependent variables, given that these are naturally
bounded \(0 \leq y \leq 1\) (Buntaine, 2011; Eskelson, Madsen, Hagar, \&
Temesgen, 2011; Gallardo, Bovea, Colomer, \& Prades, 2012; Hubben et
al., 2008; Peplonska et al., 2012). More generally, however, the beta
distribution is a doubly bounded continuous distribution: Although it is
on a continuous scale, values cannot be exceed the upper bound, \(u\),
or be less than the lower bound, \(l\). In the case of the zero-and-one
inflated beta distribution, \(l = 0\) and \(u = 1\).

Most scales used to measure prejudice and political attitudes are doubly
bounded and continuous. Although researchers generally model variables
on Likert scales and sliding scales (e.g., feeling thermometers) as
being conditionally normally distributed (i.e., using ordinary least
squares regression), these variables are not strictly normal.
Observations from a normal distribution can take on any value on the
real number line, while observations from a standard 7-point Likert
scale can only take on values 1 through 7---and in studying
controversial and polarizing issues like prejudice and politics, many
participants score at the lower or upper bounds, causing floor or
ceiling effects. In these cases, the assumptions of normality and
homoskedasticity are likely to be violated. Many times researchers
create, update, or seek out measures to so that the distributional form
of the dependent variable takes on a normal shape---statistical
assumptions are directing the phenomenon researchers choose to observe
and the theoretical questions that they ask. Instead, one can explicitly
take into account that the response is doubly bounded and
heteroskedastic by using the beta regression models described above,
using a simple linear rescaling of the data.

If one observes a dependent variable limited between two bounds, there
is a straightforward way to rescale the variable to the
\(0 \leq y \leq 1\) range:

\begin{center}
$y'_i = (y_i - l) / (u - l)$
\end{center}

where \(y\) is the variable on the original scale, \(y'\) is the
rescaled variable, \(u\) is the upper bound (i.e., the largest possible
value on the scale), \(l\) is the lower bound (i.e., the smallest
possible value on the scale), and the \(i\) subscript denotes an
individual's score. On a standard 7-point Likert scale, \(l = 1\) and
\(u = 7\). This rescaling allows a researcher to explicitly model
conditional variance, floor effects, and ceiling effects using beta
regression.

\subsubsection{Conditional variance}\label{conditional-variance}

Observing a dependent variable that is doubly bounded and continuous can
produce heteroskedasticity. One of the assumptions of an OLS regression
is homoskedasticity---that the variance of the errors are unrelated to
any predictor, any linear combination of predictors, and the predicted
values. A regression equation with one predictor variable \(x\) is often
written as \(y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i + \epsilon_i\), where
\(\epsilon_i\) is how far an osbserved value \(y_i\) is from the
predicted value (i.e., the residual). Let \(\hat{y_i}\) be the predicted
value for observation \(i\), where \(\hat{y_i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i\).
We can simplify the equation to \(y_i = \hat{y_i} + \epsilon_i\), where
the residuals \(\epsilon\) are normally distributed with a mean of 0 and
some variance---that is, \(\epsilon \sim N(0, \sigma^2_\epsilon)\). We
can further simplify this to:
\(y_i|x_i \sim N(\hat{y_i}, \sigma^2_\epsilon)\), which means that each
observation of the dependent variable we make, given the predictors we
use, is normally distributed with a mean of that observation's predicted
score and some variance. The assumption of homoskedasticity is found in
that \(\sigma^2_\epsilon\) does \emph{not} have a subscript \(i\). This
means that there is one \emph{common variance} of the residuals.

Imagine one runs a regression and observes
\(\hat{y_i} = 2.5 + 1.5 \times x_i\) and \(\sigma^2_\epsilon = 9\). Say
that the first individual's score on \(x\) is 0, \(x_1 = 0\), and the
second individual's score is \(x_2 = 5\). The model then assumes that
the first person comes from a normal distribution with a mean of 4
(i.e., \(\hat{y_1}\)) and a variance of 9 (i.e., \(\sigma^2_\epsilon\)),
while the second person comes from a normal distribution with a mean of
10 and that same variance of 9. The violation of this assumption can
lead to inflated Type I errors or diminished statistical power,
depending on the type and source of the heteroskedasticity (Hayes \&
Cai, 2007; Long \& Ervin, 2000; Rosopa, Schaffer, \& Schroeder, 2013).

While common remedies for heteroskedasticity (e.g., robust standard
errors, transforming the dependent variable, weighted least squares)
treat it as a nuisance to be corrected for when calculating \(p\)-values
(Hayes \& Cai, 2007; Long \& Ervin, 2000; Rosopa et al., 2013), it could
be that explicitly modeling this conditional variance is an interesting
phenomenon per se. Heteroskedasticity can arise when the error variance
is predicted by one of the observed predictor variables, and since beta
regression models predict a shape parameter, \(\sigma\), a researcher
can explicitly model this relationship. This allows researchers to ask
questions about conditional variance: \enquote{Does the variance in
\(y\) increase as \(x\) also increases?} Since the focus of OLS
regression is the \emph{location} parameter (e.g., conditional mean),
researchers might be ignoring interesting, potentially
theoretically-relevant parts of their data. After discussing floor and
ceiling effects, I will argue that normative influences are one of these
aspects.

\subsubsection{Floor and ceiling
effects}\label{floor-and-ceiling-effects}

Floor and ceiling effects occur when there are many observations of the
dependent variable at the lower and upper bound of the scale,
respectively (Everitt \& Skrondal, 2010). Variables displaying these
effects are likely to violate numerous assumptions of ordinary least
squares regression, such as conditional normality and homoskedasticity
of variance, and can be modeled as censored or truncated. Censoring
occurs when all scores beyond some threshold are recorded at that
threshold. For example, if a researcher is measuring reaction times,
censoring occurs if they decide that any times above 5 seconds are
scored as 5. If many people took longer than 5 seconds, this censoring
can cause a ceiling effect. Truncating occurs when people who score
beyond some treshold are excluded from the data. If the researcher
simply does not record trials that take longer than 5 seconds, then the
data are truncated. A common regression technique for censored or
truncated variables are Tobit models (McBee, 2010; Smithson \& Merkle,
2013). However, standard Tobit models assume that the underlying latent
construct is normally distributed.

In the realm of prejudice and politics, I argue that it is \emph{not}
useful to think of prejudice as coming from a latent normal
distribution. I find it unlikely that if, instead of a Likert scales
going from 1 to 7, it extended from -7 to +7, one would observe a normal
distribution for the Attitude Towards Blacks scale, for example (Brigham
(1993)). I find it likely that participants would opt for the new
floor---the negative 7. This can be thought of as a decision-making
process. Using prejudice as an example, people decide whether or not
they are going to admit to feeling any prejudice. If they decide not to,
they simply circle or click all 1s (i.e., the floor). If they decide to
admit prejudice, they respond to the items. As another example: When
offering one's attitudes toward a polarizing political figure, a
participant decides whether or not to respond entirely in the negative
(i.e., at the floor), entirely in the positive (i.e., at the ceiling),
or somewhere in between. This could result in a bimodal distribution,
with both ceiling and floor effects.

This decision making process can be modeled with the inflated beta
regression models described above. Inflations at zero, one, or
zero-and-one allow researchers to measuring ceiling effects, floor
effects, and both simultaneously. While methodologists in beta
regression refer to these models as \enquote{inflated} models, a more
general label is \enquote{two-part} models (Coxe et al., 2013). When one
assumes a decision-making process behind the two parts, these models are
often referred to as \enquote{hurdle} models in the econometrics
literature (Cameron \& Trivedi, 2005; Wooldridge, 2010).

Cragg (1971) demonstrated that hurdle models are a generalization of the
Type I Tobit model (but note that, unlike the standard Tobit model, the
latent dependent construct is assumed to be conditionally \emph{beta}
distributed, which can take on many distributional forms; see Figure 1).
In economics, hurdle models are often used when dependent variables are
counts with excess 0s (see Carlevaro, Croissant, \& Hoareau, 2017 for a
review of applications). The log likelihood function for these models
can be separated in two parts: First, a logistic (or probit) regression
modeling the probability of observing \(y = 0\) versus \(y > 0\);
second, a truncated negative binomial model using just the cases where
\(y > 0\).

The inflated beta regressions can be seen as hurdle models, as the log
likelihood for the zero-and-one inflated beta regression can also be
separated in two parts: First, a multinomial logistic regression
modeling the probabilities of observing a \(y = 0\), \(y = 1\), or
\(0 < y < 1\); second, a beta regression model using just the cases
where \(0 < y < 1\). Similarly, the inflated beta regression at
\emph{either} zero \emph{or} one has a log likelihood function that can
be separated in two parts: First, a logistic regression modeling the
probability of observing \(y = c\) or \(0 < y < 1\); second, a beta
regression modeling just the cases where \(0 < y < 1\) (Rigby et al.,
2017).

Since their likelihoods can be separated, this implies a critical
assumption: That the two processes are independent, given the observed
predictors. In other words, the error terms of each submodel are assumed
to be independent of one another (where submodels refer to models
predicting each parameter, \(\mu\), \(\sigma\), \(\nu\), or \(\tau\),
separately). Dependencies between them can be modeled (referred to as
``selection'' models; Carlevaro et al., 2017; Wooldridge, 2010), but I
will not discuss these models here, as they are not extended to beta
regression.
