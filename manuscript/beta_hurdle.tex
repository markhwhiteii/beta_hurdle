\section{Statistical Background}\label{statistical-background}

\subsection{The Beta Distribution}\label{the-beta-distribution}

The beta distribution can be used to model the residuals in a
generalized linear model when the values of the dependent variable are
bounded \(0 < y < 1\) (Coxe, West, \& Aiken, 2013). The probability
density function (pdf) of the beta distribution is determined by two
parameters, \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\), that are called \enquote{shape}
parameters:

\begin{center}
$f(y;\alpha,\beta)={\Gamma(\alpha+\beta)\over\Gamma(\alpha)\Gamma(\beta)}y^{\alpha-1}(1-y)^{\beta-1}$
\end{center}

where \(\Gamma(.)\) is the gamma function. The two shape parameters pull
the mean toward zero and one, respectively. If \(\alpha\) is larger than
\(\beta\), the mean leans toward zero; if the reverse is true, the mean
leans toward one. One of the benefits of the beta distribution is that
it is flexible and can take a number of distributional shapes. ADD
FIGURE 1 HERE TO SHOW VARIOUS SHAPES.

These parameters are not intuitive to applied researchers used to using
regression and analysis of variance, however. Rigby, Stasinopoulos,
Heller, and De Bastiani (2017) \enquote{reparameterized} the beta
distribution to make it easier understand in a regression framework (but
see Ferrari \& Cribari-Neto, 2004 for a different parameterization).
Instead of predicting \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\), they parameterize the
beta distribution with two different parameters: \(\mu\) (called the
\enquote{location} parameter) and \(\sigma\) (called the \enquote{scale}
parameter), where \(\mu={\alpha\over(\alpha+\beta)}\) and
\(\sigma=\sqrt{1\over(\alpha+\beta+1)}\). \(\mu\) is equivalent to the
mean, and \(\sigma\) is related positively to the variance. (Note that
\(\sigma\) is \emph{not} the standard deviation, even though \(\sigma\)
refers to the standard deviation in many other contexts.) The variance
is equivalent to \(\sigma^2\mu(1-\mu)\). There are two important things
to note from this equation: First, the greater the \(\sigma\), the
greater the variance; Second, the variance depends on the mean. This
means that beta regression, covered shortly, will be naturally
heteroskedastic.

But how can we model dependent variables that equal zero and/or one?

\subsection{Zero-One Inflated Beta
Distribution}\label{zero-one-inflated-beta-distribution}

Rigby et al. (2017) show that the beta distribution can be
\enquote{inflated} at zero or one---that is, zeros and ones can be
modeled. This distribution is a mixture distribution. When the dependent
variable contains zeroes and ones (i.e., \(0 \leq y \leq 1\)), the pdf
for this beta mixture, \(\text{beinf}\), is:

\begin{center}
\[
\text{beinf}(y;\mu,\sigma,\nu,\tau) =
\begin{cases}
  p_0                             & \text{if } y = 0\\
  (1 - p_0 - p_1)f(y;\mu,\sigma)  & \text{if } 0 < y < 1\\
  p_1                             & \text{if } y = 1
\end{cases}
\]
\end{center}

for \(0 \leq y \leq 1\), where \(f(y;\mu,\sigma)\) is the beta pdf with
\(\mu\) and \(\sigma\) bounded \emph{between} zero and one. The two
additional parameters, \(\nu\) and \(\tau\), are mixture parameters.
\(p_0\) is the probability that a case equals zero, \(p_1\) is the
probability that a case equals one, and \(p_2\) (i.e.,
\(1 - p_0 - p_1\)) is the probability that the case comes from the beta
distribution. In terms of these two additional parameters,
\(p_0 = {\nu \over (1 + \nu + \tau)}\) and
\(p_1 = {\tau \over (1 + \nu + \tau)}\). Rearranging these
algebraically, \(\nu\) is the odds that a case is zero to being from the
beta distribution, \(\nu = p_0 / p_2\), and \(\tau\) is the odds that a
case is a one to being from the beta distribution, \(\tau = p_1 / p_2\).

\subsection{Beta Regression Models}\label{beta-regression-models}

The goal now is to predict these four parameters,
\(\mu, \sigma, \nu, \tau\), from any number of predictor variables. All
four parameters can be predicted by an identical set of predictors, none
of the same predictors, or anywhere in between. Both \(\mu\) and
\(\sigma\) have to be between zero and one, so we can use the logistic
link function to fit predicted values in this range; both \(\nu\) and
\(\tau\) have to be greater than zero, so we can use the log link
function to fit predicted values in this range. Imagine we have one
predictor, \(x\). We could include this variable as a predictor of all
four variables with the equations:

\begin{center}
$\text{log}({\mu \over 1 - \mu}) = \beta_{10} + \beta_{11}X$\\
$\text{log}({\sigma \over 1 - \sigma}) = \beta_{20} + \beta_{21}X$\\
$\text{log}(\nu) = \beta_{30} + \beta_{31}X$\\
$\text{log}(\tau) = \beta_{40} + \beta_{41}X$
\end{center}

Or, equivalently stated:

\begin{center}
$\mu={1\over1+e^{-(\beta_{10}+\beta_{11}X)}}$\\
$\sigma={1\over1+e^{-(\beta_{20}+\beta_{21}X)}}$\\
$\nu = e^{\beta_{30} + \beta_{31}X}$\\
$\tau = e^{\beta_{40} + \beta_{41}X}$
\end{center}

where \(e^x\) is the natural exponential function. A regression model
can also be used when the dependent variable contains zeros but no ones
(e.g., \(0 \leq y < 1\)) or when it contains ones but no zeros (e.g.,
\(0 < y \leq 1\)). Let \(c\) be the value---0 or 1---that is inflated.
The pdf is:

\begin{center}
\[
\text{beinf}_c(y;\mu,\sigma,\nu) =
\begin{cases}
  p_c                             & \text{if } y = c\\
  (1 - p_c)f(y;\mu,\sigma)        & \text{if } 0 < y < 1\\
\end{cases}
\]
\end{center}

where \(\nu = p_c / (1 - p_c)\) and everything else is the same as
above. The same link functions are used as above, but the fourth
parameter, \(\tau\), is not included, as the dependent variable can only
take on values of \(c\) or from the beta distribution. Lastly, if no
zeros or ones are observed, the beta distribution alone can be used as
the pdf. This results in a beta regression where the researcher is only
predicting the location, \(\mu\), and shape, \(\sigma\). Since there is
no mixture with values of being 0 or 1, the latter two mixture
parameters, \(\nu\) and \(\tau\), are not included.

\section{Applications to Social and Personality Psychology (NEW
NAME?)}\label{applications-to-social-and-personality-psychology-new-name}

These beta regression models are often used when dealing with rates and
proportions, given that these are naturally bounded \(0 \leq y \leq 1\)
(Buntaine, 2011; Eskelson, Madsen, Hagar, \& Temesgen, 2011; Gallardo,
Bovea, Colomer, \& Prades, 2012; Hubben et al., 2008; Peplonska et al.,
2012). The beta distribution is doubly bounded continuous distribution,
meaning that, although it is on a continuous scale, values cannot be
greater than the upper bound, \(u\), or lesser than the lower bound,
\(l\). Although researchers generally model variables on Likert scales
and sliding scales (e.g., feeling thermometers) as being conditionally
normally distributed, these variables are, by definition, not strictly
normal.

Observations from a normal distribution can take on any value on the
real number line. Observations from a standard, 1 (Strongly Disagree) to
7 (Strongly Agree) Likert scale can only take on values between 1 and 7.
There are no meaningful negative consequences of using the normal
distribution to model a variable with observed \(M = 4.0\) and
\(SD = 0.8\), given that virtually all of the distribution falls between
1 and 7 anyways. However, measures in prejudice and politics are often
skewed toward one of the poles, such as \(M = 2.0\) and \(SD = 1.5\). In
this case, one might observe predicted values outside the bounds, and
the model is likely to violate the assumption of homoskedasticity, as
well. SHOW EXAMPLES IN FIGURE 2. While some advocate for using robust
estimators for standard errors to address this problem {[}CITE{]}, one
can explicitly take into account that the response is doubly bounded by
using the beta regression models described above.

If one observes a dependent variable limited between two bounds, there
is a straightforward way to rescale the variable to the
\(0 \leq y \leq 1\) range:

\begin{center}
$y'_i = (y_i - l) / (u - l)$
\end{center}

where \(y\) is the variable on the original scale, \(y'\) is the
transformed variable, \(u\) is the upper bound (i.e., the largest
possible value on the scale), \(l\) is the lower bound (i.e., the
smallest possible value on the scale), and the \(i\) subscript denotes
an individual's score. On a standard 7-point Likert scale, \(l = 1\) and
\(u = 7\). This transformation allows a researcher to explicitly model
conditional variance, floor effects, and ceiling effects.
